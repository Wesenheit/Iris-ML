How to replace MCMC inference for the set-like dataset? Following repository contains my implementation of Set-Invariant transformer + Masked Autoregressive Flow,
both of which can be used to perform Likelihood-free inference for the set-like datasets.
Moreover, a science case is presented where the model is applied to infer paramters of stars based on the broadband photmetry.
